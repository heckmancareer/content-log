# CoverUploaderComponent

## Overview
'Covers' are the universally sized images that are used to represent any given entity. This component is intended for form components that allow users to upload and view covers. When uploading a new cover, the component holds the state of the cropped image as a Buffer that can then be written to the back-end. However, if this is a pre-existing cover that's stored on the file system, then it can just resolve the image path for better performance.
